## Introduction
Web3 security is a crucial aspect of the decentralized web. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and mastering Web3 security through my personal journey, resources, and insights at each stage.

## Disclaimer
I acknowledge that my language skills may be limited, and I might not express myself as eloquently as I wish. I can only convey my experiences in the most straightforward way. If you choose to read on, I sincerely appreciate it.

## My Journey

### 2022
A friend suggested that I explore Web3, hinting that it might hold something exciting for me. I followed his advice, researched Web3, and understood its basic concept, but I was unsure of my role or potential in it, so I gave up.

### Mid-2023
While preparing for an important competition, my uncle suggested I try learning smart contract development. He provided some resources and assured me it was a promising direction. Although I respected his advice (as he is the most accomplished person in our family), I was skeptical because he wasn't in the IT industry, and I believed my perspective might be more insightful.

I approached smart contract development with caution, gathered some tutorials, and started learning. I found it abstract and didn't understand what "smart contracts" truly were, what they could do, or if they could be profitable. After some time, I looked into policies and job prospects, finding few positions available and little government support. I hastily concluded that my uncle might have been misinformed, leading me to abandon this path again.

> Later, I realized my uncle's advice was likely correct. I learned not to dismiss others' suggestions too quickly, as they might be valuable.

### August 2023
Through a blogger named Digital Nomad, I learned about the concept of "digital nomads"—freelancers not bound by location. While this lifestyle intrigued me, I didn't know how to become one, what skills to learn, or what jobs to pursue, so I remained an observer.

### October 2024
Thanks to Digital Nomad's sharing, I discovered a [GitHub project for Web3 job recruitment platforms](https://github.com/Web3-Club/Web3-Recruitment-Platform). This marked the beginning of my decision to join the Web3 industry. After some research, I decided to go all-in on Web3 (the reasons are lengthy, so I won't elaborate here, but I might write about it later if anyone is interested).

### Early Learning
Through Digital Nomad's recommendations, I found two fundamental courses: one by Professor Xiao Zhen from Peking University on blockchain technology and applications, and another by multiple professors from Stanford University (I haven't watched this one, so I'm not sure about the details).

At this point, I was still like a headless chicken, knowing only the general direction—I wanted to enter the Web3 industry but didn't know the specific learning path or what to study. So, I decided to start with the foundational courses mentioned earlier.

### A Change in Approach
I'm grateful for my previous understanding that in the computer industry, simply studying in isolation isn't enough. You must engage with others, as a single insightful comment from an expert can be invaluable. During this phase, while watching Professor Xiao Zhen's course, I began searching for Web3 information on social media. By chance, I found a blogger on Xiaohongshu who seemed like a Web3 expert (and indeed was, as later confirmed). He had created a Web3 group with only ten members, and I applied to join out of curiosity.

### The Importance of a Good Mentor
I initially thought that by learning blockchain basics and smart contract development, then finding an entry-level internship through recruitment platforms, I could successfully enter the industry.

The "he" mentioned here is the expert I referred to earlier. After communicating with him, he kindly shared several important points:

1. I explained that I was studying foundational courses, and he advised that I didn't need to delve into so much theoretical knowledge early on. It might be more beneficial to revisit these principles when encountering problems.
2. I initially aimed to enter the field as a smart contract developer, but he informed me that companies mainly seek experienced developers skilled in gas optimization, not newcomers. This creates a catch-22: "How can I gain experience without entering the field, and how can I enter the field without experience?" He introduced me to a direction I hadn't considered—smart contract security competitions, or "CTF." By participating in these competitions, I could gain experience and eventually enter the Web3 security field.

> I believe a tutorial cannot fundamentally change a person in an instant, but an inspiring story and a key insight can potentially change a person's life.

### Trying to Forge My Own Path
The mentor recommended that I first learn the basics of contract development and framework knowledge, then start practicing CTF exercises (similar to practicing algorithms before a competition) until I master them thoroughly, and then participate in formal competitions.

However, I found two bloggers on Twitter and YouTube who recommended starting competitions as soon as possible to grow quickly, rather than spending too much time on practice exercises. I agree with this approach and prefer it, so I plan to start competing as soon as I finish the necessary basics, rather than following the mentor's advice to complete all practice exercises first. Perhaps this is related to my lifelong tendency to take unconventional paths.
